# dramatiq_dashboard

A dashboard for [dramatiq], specific to its Redis broker (sorry
RabbitMQ users!).  Very alpha stuff.

It comes in the form of a WSGI middleware, with as few dependencies as
possible (`dramatiq`, `jinja2` and `redis`) so it's super easy to plug
into whatever web application you have.

## Installation

    pip install dramatiq_dashboard

## Quickstart

#### Run the dashboard on top of an existing WSGI app

```python
# Assuming at some point you instantiate your app.
app = create_wsgi_application()

# Import the library, create the middleware and wrap your app with it.
import dramatiq_dashboard

dashboard_middleware = dramatiq_dashboard.make_wsgi_middleware("/drama")
app = dashboard_middleware(app)
```

Run your app, visit `/drama` and you should see the dashboard.

#### Run the dashboard as a standalone webserver

If you don't want to wrap an existing WSGI app, you can also run the
dashboard as a standalone server.  Install the WSGI server of your
choice (e.g. uWSGi, gunicorn, bjoern, etc), setup the Redis broker,
and then start `DashboardApp` directly.

For example, to serve the dashboard on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` using
the `bjoern` WSGI server and a redis server on `17.0.0.1:6379`, run
the following:

```python
import bjoern
import dramatiq
from dramatiq.brokers.redis import RedisBroker
from dramatiq_dashboard import DashboardApp

broker = RedisBroker(host="127.0.0.1", port=6379)
broker.declare_queue("default")
dramatiq.set_broker(broker)
app = DashboardApp(broker=broker, prefix="")
bjoern.run(app, "127.0.0.1", 8080)
```

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see the running dashboard.

*Note that if you use custom queues in your application, they won't be
discovered using this approach.  You'll have to either add each one of
them manually to your broker or import and pass your application's
broker to `DashboardApp`.*
